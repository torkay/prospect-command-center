Generated: 2026-02-15

## Email Cadence (4 touches)

### Email 1 – Search, enrich, score.
**Subject:** Turn search into your daily lead feed
**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

Most agencies spend hours digging around LinkedIn, directories, and Google Ads to find one solid prospect. LeadSwarm automates that work: you run a search (vertical + location), and LeadSwarm delivers a ranked list of businesses with contact info, website scoring, and the exact signal that makes them call-worthy.

Want to see it in action? I can have LeadSwarm surface 10 warm prospects for your ICP in under 5 minutes.

[Start trial](/register) and skip the manual prospecting.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 2 – Proof over promise.
**Subject:** Proof: one list, no guesswork
**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Here’s how the most disciplined teams use LeadSwarm:

1. Run one search for a vertical + location.
2. Copy the scored prospects with context (missing analytics, booking gaps, outdated contact pages).
3. Drop the notes straight into outreach.

No generic database, no stale lists—just real signals you can call or DM within minutes.

If you want to move faster, [Start trial](/register) and you’ll have the same workflow in your own account today.

Cheers,

### Email 3 – Make it about their stack.
**Subject:** Prospecting that actually fits your workflow
**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

Do you ever wish the first call in your pipeline already had the story laid out? LeadSwarm gives it to you. Each record includes:

- Contactability flags (email, phone, LinkedIn) + validation notes

- Fit / Opportunity / Priority scores so you can call the hottest leads right away

You can export, push to your CRM, or just copy the notes into your next outreach batch.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 4 – Breakup/extra nudge.
**Subject:** Last ping: want a better lead feed?
**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

If you’re still prospecting with spreadsheets or semi-manual plays, that’s exactly what LeadSwarm replaces. Search once, get the list daily, and know why each company should hear from you.

If you’d rather explore with a teammate, just hit reply with your ideal client profile. Otherwise, the fastest way in is to [Start trial](/register) and run whatever search you want.

## LinkedIn DM follow-ups (2)
1. **First DM – Quick intro.**
Hey [First Name], love what you’re doing at [Company]. What if you could automate the prospect list that matches your niche + geography? LeadSwarm runs search, enrich, and scoring so your team never has to chase leads that go nowhere. I can show you in 5 min or you can [Start trial](/register) and explore it yourself.

2. **Second DM – Signal push.**
Hey [First Name], spotted that [Recent Signal or Pain Point]. LeadSwarm can flag that signal automatically (missing analytics, slow site speed, no book-a-call flow) and give you contact + context in a single list. If you want to test it, [Start trial](/register) and run a search for that same signal.

## Follow-up rules
- Wait 3 business days between emails and document each touch in your CRM.
- After the fourth email, pause for one week before a LinkedIn DM touch.
- If a prospect responds, stop the sequence. Focus on booking a call and export their list.
- Use the LinkedIn DMs as gentle nudges: DM 1 should follow email 2, DM 2 after email 3 for any still-unengaged contacts.
- Log all CTA clicks; if they hit “Start trial,” ask what scenario they want to explore before scheduling a demo.

## Personalization slots
1. `[First Name]` – keeps outreach human.
2. `[Company / Agency Name]` – reinforce you know their shop.
3. `[Target Vertical]` – highlight the search/vertical combination.
4. `[Recent Signal]` – e.g., “missing analytics,” “slow booking flow,” “running Google Ads but no conversion tracking.”
5. `[Location or Region]` – ties into the localized search promise.
6. `[Competitive Nod]` – mention the platform they currently use or their focus (e.g., “You lean heavily on local SEO”).
